## Social Media Post
A social media company needs to analyze posts.
Example: "If a walk across the park takes 5 minutes, and a walk to the grocery store takes 10 minutes."
Your job is to implement the following method:

- GetIndividualWordCount(string word): Get the word count for the input word (the example above has 2 occurrences of the word "walk")

- GetDistinctWordCount(): Get the total number of distinct words (the example above has 14 distinct words)

- processPost(): Implement an algorithm to process the post into a data structure

Helpful Hints:
- Think about what data structure to store the post so that it is easy to determine the distinct word count and the individual word counts
- The wordDelimiters are already provided
