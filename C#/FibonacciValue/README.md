## Fibonacci Value
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the previous two numbers, starting with 0 and 1.

The Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55…

Written as a rule:
Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2

It's common to refer to Fibonacci values by their index.  

For example, Fib(6) = 8:  the Fibonacci value at index 6 is 8. Or Fib(0) = 0 (noticed 0 based indexing).


Write a function to return the Fibonacci value given the index.
